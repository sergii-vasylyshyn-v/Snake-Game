## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game, built entirely using pure JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks. The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body. As the snake eats, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of the game!
